# DDoS-Attack-Detection-from-Network-Packets
Detecting DDoS attacks using packet analysis and basic ML models.


# Problem Statement

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are one of the most common types of cyberattacks. In such an attack, a large amount of traffic is sent towards a server or network with the goal of slowing it down or making it unavailable.

In this project, the aim is to analyze network traffic data (packets or flows) and build a simple system that can tell whether the traffic is normal or if it looks like a DDoS attack.

The idea is to extract basic features from network packets (like number of packets per second, size of packets, number of unique source IPs, etc.), then train a machine learning model that can learn the difference between normal traffic and attack traffic.


# Objectives

1. Collect or use an existing dataset of network traffic.
2. Extract simple features from the data (packet counts, average size, protocol type, etc.).
3. Train a basic machine learning model (for example, Random Forest).
4. Test the model on unseen data and check accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Create a small demo where the system can take network traffic as input and give an alert if it detects an attack.


# Scope

Input: Network traffic (in PCAP format or CSV after feature extraction).

Output: A simple result showing if the traffic is “Normal” or “DDoS Attack”.

The first version will be offline (using dataset files). Later, it can be extended to real-time detection using packet sniffing.


# Deliverables

1. Preprocessed dataset with features.
2. A trained ML model with evaluation results.
3. Python code for training and testing.
4. A simple script or demo that shows detection.


# Future Improvements

Once the basic version is ready, it can be improved by:
1. Using more advanced features from packets.
2. Testing deep learning models like LSTMs for time-series traffic.
3. Running detection on live traffic instead of only dataset files.
4. Extending to multiple types of attacks (SYN flood, UDP flood, etc.).
